# Thermal Monitor

A comprehensive PowerShell toolkit for monitoring and diagnosing system thermal issues on Windows. Includes two specialized scripts:

- **ThermalMonitor.ps1**: Main system thermal monitoring with CPU/GPU usage, temperatures, and thermal throttling detection
- **ChromeTabMonitor.ps1**: Real-time Chrome process analysis to identify resource-heavy tabs and extensions

Helps identify resource-heavy processes and system-level signals contributing to overheating. Optional integration with LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor adds stronger temperature, CPU package power, and fan data. Ideal for diagnosing performance issues and Chrome-specific resource consumption.

## How the Script Works

- **Logs Data:** Saves output to a log file in `C:\Temp` with a timestamped filename (e.g., `ThermalMonitor_20250722_083512.log`).
- **CPU Usage:** Uses performance counters to get real-time CPU usage percentage for the top 10 processes, with intelligent aggregation of multiple process instances and fallback to CPU time if counters aren't available.
- **GPU Usage:** Attempts to retrieve GPU engine utilization using Windows performance counters, resolves GPU counter PIDs back to process names, and aggregates utilization by process (availability varies by system and GPU).
- **CPU Performance Scaling:** Uses Windows `Processor Information` counters to log processor performance and maximum-frequency percentage, which is more useful for throttling detection than WMI clock speed alone.
- **Kernel/Driver Activity:** Logs DPC and interrupt time to flag possible device-driver or kernel-side heat causes that may not show up as a normal app process.
- **Disk and Network Activity:** Tracks total disk/network throughput and per-process I/O rates to expose sustained storage or network work that can contribute to heat.
- **CPU Temperature:** Tries LibreHardwareMonitor first, then Open Hardware Monitor, then Windows built-in thermal zones. Includes temperature averaging and validation. Displays temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit for convenience.
- **Process Tracking:** Maintains historical data for each process across all monitoring cycles to identify sustained heat sources.
- **Heat Analysis:** Calculates a "heat score" for each process based on sustained CPU usage, GPU usage, process I/O, peak usage, memory consumption, and time presence to identify the most likely culprits.
- **Thermal Throttling Detection:** Combines CPU performance counters, WMI clock speed, CPU load, and temperature evidence before classifying likely thermal throttling.
- **Monitoring Loop:** Runs for 5 minutes, checking every 10 seconds, and logs all data with real-time warnings for high temperatures and throttling.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays progress bars, spinning animations, colored status messages, and a comprehensive heat analysis report at the end.

## Prerequisites

- **Run as Administrator:** Performance counters and some WMI queries require elevated privileges. Right-click PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator."
- **LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor (Optional):** For enhanced temperature, CPU package power, and fan data, download and run LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor before executing the script. The script will attempt to use Windows built-in thermal sensors as fallback.
- **Windows 10/11:** GPU performance counters work best on modern Windows versions with supported GPUs and drivers.

## Interpreting the Results

### ThermalMonitor.ps1 Results

#### Heat Analysis Report
The script automatically generates a comprehensive heat analysis report at the end, ranking processes by their "heat score":

- **Heat Score Calculation:** Combines sustained CPU load (average CPU × time present), sustained GPU load, process I/O activity, peak CPU/GPU impact, and memory pressure
- **Top Heat Culprits:** Shows the top 5 processes most likely responsible for system heating
- **Process Metrics:** Displays average CPU usage, maximum CPU usage, GPU usage, process I/O, memory consumption, and percentage of time the process was active
- **Color Coding:** Red indicates high heat scores (>50), yellow indicates moderate scores (>25)

### Temperature Analysis
- **Temperature Averaging:** Shows average and maximum temperatures throughout the monitoring period in both Celsius and Fahrenheit
- **Power and Fan Data:** Shows CPU package power and fan RPM when exposed by LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor
- **High Temperature Warnings:** Alerts when temperatures exceed 85°C (185°F)
- **Multiple Sources:** Uses LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor data when available, falls back to Windows thermal zones
- **Dual Scale Display:** All temperature readings are shown in both °C and °F for user convenience

### Throttling Detection
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks CPU performance scaling and clock speed changes throughout monitoring
- **Throttling Events:** Reports frequency and percentage of time throttling occurred
- **Performance Impact:** Shows processor performance/frequency percentage plus current vs maximum clock speeds to assess throttling severity

### System Signals
- **Driver/Kernel Activity:** Summarizes DPC and interrupt time, which can indicate driver or device-related heat when no app stands out

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues
- **Permission Errors:** Always run PowerShell as Administrator for full functionality
- **Performance Counter Issues:** Both scripts include fallbacks if performance counters are unavailable

### ThermalMonitor.ps1 Issues
- **No Temperature Data:** Install and run LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor, or check if your system exposes ACPI thermal zones
- **No GPU Data:** Ensure you have Windows 10 build 17763+ with WDDM 2.0+ drivers
- **No CPU Power/Fan Data:** These values require LibreHardwareMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor and may not be exposed by every laptop sensor controller
- **High DPC/Interrupt Activity:** Update chipset, storage, network, audio, and graphics drivers; disconnect external devices to compare behavior

### ChromeTabMonitor.ps1 Issues
- **No Chrome Processes Found:** Ensure Chrome is running before starting the monitor
- **Access Denied Errors:** Some Chrome processes may be protected; run as Administrator for complete access
- **High CPU Usage from Monitor:** Reduce refresh frequency with `-RefreshInterval 10` or higher
- **CSV Export Fails:** Check that the export directory exists and is writable
- **Inaccurate CPU Readings:** Performance counter availability varies by system; the script falls back to time-based estimates
